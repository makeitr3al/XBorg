<summary>Where will XBorg be in three years?</summary>

Our vision for the next three years is to transform XBorg into a fully decentralized protocol with a plethora of user applications while simultaneously establishing ourselves as the preeminent gaming credential network. Through grant programs and active support for player initiatives, we aspire to empower countless gamers and facilitate the rise of player-owned gaming entities, including esports teams and studios. With a commitment to ongoing innovation and progress, we anticipate XBorg emerging as the dominant gaming ecosystem in the Web3 sphere and beyond, paving the way for future forays into other entertainment sectors and community empowerment initiatives.\

<summary>What is the biggest threat (or weakness) to XBorg in implementing the roadmap?</summary>

**Regulatory risks**

Like every Web3 project, the regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets may impede the execution of certain roadmap items. Should certain NFTs or tokens be considered securities under certain jurisdictions, this would harm our ecosystem or may impact the utilities of the XBG token.

**Data governance**

Furthermore, XBorg's utilization of third-party APIs sourced from reputable entities such as Steam and Faceit engenders potential data governance issues, as discontinuing said collaborations would inevitably result in diminished data quality.

**Credential network traction**

The adoption risk for any protocol cannot be overstated, as it represents a potential hurdle to its success. Hence, a robust initial growth plan is essential. In line with this, we have identified the Fan engagement app and strategic partnerships with esports teams as the most effective avenues for attaining the critical mass of the XBorg protocol.
