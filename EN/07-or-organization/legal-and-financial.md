<summary>What is the liquidity situation of XBorg? What amount is held in the treasury, and who has access to it currently?</summary>

Excluding the ongoing seed round, XBorg currently holds $800,000 in its treasury. Given our gross monthly burn rate of $40,000, this equates to a runway of approximately 20 months, even if no additional profits are made during this period. As for treasury management, the funds are securely kept in several Gnosis safes (multi-signature wallets). Access to these funds is strictly controlled and currently managed by Louis (XBorg's CEO), the SwissBorg treasurer, along with one additional SwissBorg executive.

<summary>How does XBorg approach risk management, especially in the event of an extended bear market?</summary>

Risk management is a critical aspect of our operations at XBorg. We adopt a lean operational model that allows us to maintain a relatively low monthly burn rate of $40,000, which covers the compensation for our team of 12 full-time team members. By maintaining an average salary of approximately $3.3k per month per employee, we ensure we attract and retain high-quality talent while keeping our expenses manageable.

In the case of an extended bear market, our current financial strategy provides us with a sufficient runway to continue executing our roadmap without an immediate need for additional funds.
