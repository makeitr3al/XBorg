# XBG

XBG is the native token that fuels the XBorg protocol. It is the primary payment method, capturing all the value and revenues generated within the ecosystem. In addition, it provides access to protocol governance, allowing token holders to actively participate in shaping the platform's future.

<details>

<summary>On which blockchain is the XBG token going to be deployed?</summary>

The XBG token is set to be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and will be bridged to the Polygon network for enhanced scalability and efficiency. Additionally, a separate allocation of XBG tokens will be set aside for deployment on the Borg chain once it's fully operational. This multi-chain approach ensures broad accessibility and versatility for our token holders.

<details>

<summary>Why has XBorg decided to issue a token?</summary>

XBorg is deeply committed to fostering a community-centric ecosystem, and our decision to issue a token reflects this commitment. Unlike traditional corporate models that focus on share-based value accrual, all cash flows generated within our ecosystem are redirected to the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) treasury. This model facilitates more direct community involvement and aligns interests more effectively.

By introducing the XBG token, we create an in-protocol economy where the token serves as the primary means of transaction. This move signals a shift towards a more participatory, community-driven model, wherein every member has a say in the platform's direction and shares in its success. It's an innovative approach that underscores our belief in the transformative potential of decentralized networks.

<details>

<summary>What is the total supply of XBG tokens?</summary>

The maximum supply of XBG tokens has been set at 1,000,000,000 (1 billion).

</details>

<details>

<summary>When will the XBG Token Generation Event (TGE) take place?</summary>

The TGE will occur towards summer 2024.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why can't you give an exact TGE date?</summary>

As a team, we believe that the crypto outlook towards the end of 2023 and close to Bitcoin halvings will be positive. The XBorg team is currently engaging in talks with top-tier exchanges, whose opinions hold considerable weight in determining the ideal timing for token listing. It's important to note that launching a token during periods of uncertain liquidity and interest in alternative coins can pose a risk.

In addition, we recognize that a token's value lies in the strength of the ecosystem it operates in. Therefore, our goal is to cultivate a user base of at least 100,000 prior to launching the token.

Looking ahead, our team is optimistic about the crypto market's potential towards the end of 2023, particularly in light of upcoming Bitcoin halvings.

<summary>What's the token utility?</summary>

The XBG token plays a crucial role in the network, serving as the primary means of payment, governance, and protocol incentives.

**In-app payments & Platform fees**

XBG is the primary method of payment and transactions across the protocol, which is subject to certain fees. For Web2 users preferring fiat payment, XBorg acquires the equivalent of XBG tokens on the open market. The list of fees collected via the protocol can be found on the slide: Protocol Sustainability & Revenue. Those fees are charged in XBG.

**Governance**

The XBG token is used for governance actions in the XBorg DAO upon the Token Generation Event. XBG token holders have the ability to vote on key decisions regarding the development of the protocol.

**Staking**

50% of the fees and revenues paid in XBG are designated for the staking reward pool. The amount of staking rewards received is determined by the duration of the lockup period and the individual's status within the protocol.

**Protocol Access**

Some functionalities and utilities of the protocol are subject to access restrictions based on the quantity of XBG held and the user's status within the protocol.

<details>

<summary>Does XBG have a burning mechanism?</summary>

Currently, 50% of revenues are allocated to staking yield whilst the remainder is allocated to the treasury. The governance could decide the exact revenue split and allocate a portion for a burn mechanism.
