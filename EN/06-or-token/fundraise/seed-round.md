To participate in the round, you may acquire a Prometheus NFT [here](https://opensea.io/collection/xborg-prometheus) and take part in our [launchpad](https://launchpad.xborg.com/). Alternatively, you can download the SwissBorg app to access the investment opportunities. However, it should be noted that only Prometheus holders are guaranteed an allocation, and the current level of interest for the round surpasses $4.5 million.
