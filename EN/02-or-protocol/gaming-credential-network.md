<summary>Why build a Gaming Credential Network?</summary>

In today's society, where leisure time is becoming increasingly abundant, players spend countless hours immersed in gaming worlds. Yet, the data generated from these experiences is often undervalued and fragmented across multiple games. XBorg recognizes the value of players' time and seeks to make their data meaningful and valuable. Think of it as a gaming [**Decentralized Identifier (DID)**](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) system.\
\
Furthermore, the Gaming Credential Network allows for the creation of better gaming applications and interoperability bound to the identity of players.

<summary>What are the benefits for developers?</summary>

* Developers can develop custom player experiences
* Businesses can acquire users by targeting players for a fee
* The Gaming Credential Network provides instant access to games and developers, expanding their reach
* Developers can access more granular data, enhancing matchmaking accuracy and other app features
* The platform enables new use cases for applications, including reputation-based lending

<details>

<summary>How is data privacy handled?</summary>

Iterations of the protocol in the future will allow players to disclose pertinent data points selectively by enabling opt-in/opt-out functionality. Furthermore, zero-knowledge technologies are set to be incorporated in subsequent updates, underscoring the platform's unwavering commitment to privacy and data security.

<details>

<summary>Is the Gaming Credential Network on-chain?</summary>

At present, the Gaming Credential Network is securely stored off-chain. However, as the ecosystem garners traction and the user base surpasses the 100,000 threshold, the network will seamlessly transition onto the blockchain, underscoring XBorg's steadfast commitment to accessibility and transparency.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is the dev documentation or SDK ready?</summary>

It's currently in the works but probably won't be released until the end of summer 2024.

</details>

<details>

<summary>On which blockchain will the Credential Network be built?</summary>

Initially, Polygon and other L2. As the Network gains traction, it will become its own L2/L3, known as the Borg chain.

<summary>What are the limitations of the Gaming Credential Network?</summary>

* **Sybil resistance:** An inherent constraint of network infrastructure lies in the susceptibility of its users to adopt false personas or leverage advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to manipulate their digital identities. To mitigate the detrimental effects of Sybil attacks, one effective strategy involves the incorporation of a Proof of Identity mechanism into the network's underlying protocol.

* **Scale**: The true value proposition of the credential network is contingent upon achieving a requisite level of network scale, a priority that currently holds significant strategic importance for XBorg. However, once this objective is realized, the potential utilities that can be derived from the network are truly boundless.
