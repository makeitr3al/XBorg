<summary>I made a tweet, why are my points not updated?</summary>

We refresh the data every 24 hours, so your score will be updated accordingly. Keep in mind that a tweet first needs to have a certain amount of engagement (views, likes, comments, retweets) to be counted by [LunarCrush](lunarcrush-test.md). This could result in a delay of up to 48 hours. It's worth noting that there is no limit to the number of tweets you can post in a day. When tweeting frequently and consistently, the processing delays of LunarCrush have a lesser impact.

<summary>What I need to do, to get the most points?</summary>

To secure the highest points for the season, the goal is to aim for the highest position in the rankings each day. Consistently being among the top 300 participants forms a strong foundation, but achieving a prominent rank is an achievement that secures the maximum points.

Maintaining a regular presence is crucial to avoid missing out on daily points. To further optimize your daily points, consider these best practices:

Utilize the [LunarCrush ](lunarcrush-test.md)influence score. Maintain a consistent posting schedule (10-40 times daily for top influencers). Use accurate $tickers and #hashtags (#XBorg, $XBG, and #XBG). Offer valuable content to engage your followers. Interact with relevant posts, particularly those related to tokens, exchanges, or NFTs you're passionate about. Prioritize visual appeal by using high-quality visuals. Tag other influential individuals and notable figures associated with the tokens you focus on. Avoid excessive use of irrelevant hashtags to prevent spam.
