<summary>What are leagues?</summary>

Leagues are akin to tiers in a football championship. They reflect your performance level during the qualifiers, grouping players with comparable achievements for competitive matchups. A higher league ranking leads to greater rewards. Further details will be revealed upon the launch of the inaugural season.

<summary>In what league I'm getting assigned?</summary>

Your league assignment depends on your ranking during the qualification phases. Participants accumulate daily points and climb the leaderboard, leading to final rankings after Qualification Phase 1 and Qualification Phase 2. Based on the collective achievements and the total number of participants, slots are assigned across different Leagues.

Top performers from each qualification phase receive invitations to join the most suitable league based on their skill levels.

As seasons progress, leagues operate on a promotion/relegation basis. The top performers ascend to higher leagues, while those with less success are moved to lower leagues.

If you join after the qualification phases, you'll enter the Amateur League. This league not only offers its set of rewards but also provides a chance to progress to higher divisions and secure/enhance rewards.
