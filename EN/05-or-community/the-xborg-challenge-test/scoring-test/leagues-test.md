# Leagues

<details>

<summary>What are leagues?</summary>

Leagues are akin to tiers in a football championship. They reflect your performance level during the qualifiers, grouping players with comparable achievements for competitive matchups. A higher league ranking leads to greater rewards. Further details will be revealed upon the launch of the inaugural season.

<summary>In what league I'm getting assigned?</summary>

Your league assignment depends on your ranking during the qualification phases. Participants accumulate daily points and climb the leaderboard, leading to final rankings after Qualification Phase 1 and Qualification Phase 2. Based on the collective achievements and the total number of participants, slots are assigned across different Leagues.

Top performers from each qualification phase receive invitations to join the most suitable league based on their skill levels.

As seasons progress, leagues operate on a promotion/relegation basis. The top performers ascend to higher leagues, while those with less success are moved to lower leagues.

If you join after the qualification phases, you'll enter the Amateur League. This league not only offers its set of rewards but also provides a chance to progress to higher divisions and secure/enhance rewards.

<summary>Can influencers move between different tiers or divisions based on their performance over time?</summary>

Influencers are ranked within their respective divisions. The top performers advance to the higher division (up to the Premier League), while those with lower rankings are relegated to lower divisions, eventually reaching the lowest tier, the Amateur League. Additionally, if an influencer fails to achieve a minimum of X days where they earn points, they will be moved down to a lower division. In such cases, they will only receive the minimum reward for the current season without being eligible for the collective boost. This system encourages influencers to consistently perform well and maintain their division status.

<summary>Are there any specific rules or criteria for determining an influencer's level of reach for league placement?</summary>

Access to a league is determined by an influencer's final performance during Qualification Phases 1 and 2. Subsequent season results may lead to maintaining the same division, progressing to a higher division, or being relegated.

<summary>How will participants be grouped or matched in the league system to ensure fair competition?</summary>

Just like in soccer, top performers compete against fellow top performers, and so on.

<details>

<summary>Are there different tiers or divisions within the league system based on reach levels?</summary>

In the qualification rounds, everyone competes against each other. During the first season, individuals are sorted into various leagues based on their previous performance.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does progression or promotion within the league system work? Is it based on points or other factors?</summary>

Advancement within the same league is determined by accumulated points. Each league features collective milestones that participants aim to achieve, providing benefits to all members. For more information, visit [rewards](../rewards-test.md).

<details>

<summary>Are there rewards or incentives for performing well within the league system?</summary>

No, as we reward overall performance at the end of the competition, additional incentives are not provided. However, it's important to note that to be eligible for the league reward, participants must earn points for a minimum of 7 days within the month. Anyone who advances to a higher league will automatically receive a greater reward.

<summary>What happens if an influencer's reach changes between the qualifier and league phases?</summary>

If an influencer's reach significantly changes between the qualification phase and the league phase, it does not impact their position within the league or previous rewards.

However, it's important to note that from the league phase onwards, the league ranking holds significance. An influencer who increases their reach is likely to move up to a higher division in the following season, while one who experiences a decrease in reach might face relegation.

Another crucial aspect is that, within the leagues, generating points on a minimum of 7 different days is required to be eligible for the league reward.
