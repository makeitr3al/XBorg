<summary>What are XBorg's priorities for 2023?</summary>

The top priorities of XBorg are focused on several critical areas of strategic development. Firstly, the team is actively building a robust and engaging Fan Engagement App (xborg.gg) that is both stable and captivating. Secondly, the company is committed to augmenting its technical talent pool to facilitate the continued growth and expansion of its applications and credential network. XBorg is also dedicated to pursuing strategic business development opportunities with leading Esports teams to enhance the platform's user engagement and appeal.\
\
With its focus on sustainable growth, XBorg is exploring a range of monetization strategies, including wearable drops, monthly user and business subscriptions, and other innovative revenue streams. Finally, XBorg is preparing for a decentralized future by launching the XBG token and making it available on Tier 1 exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase, and Tier 2 exchanges, like Bybit, Bitfinex, and Kucoin. By pursuing these strategic priorities, XBorg is poised to revolutionize the gaming industry and cement its position as a leader in the rapidly-evolving world of Web3 technology.

<summary>What is the biggest threat (or weakness) to XBorg in implementing the roadmap?</summary>

**Regulatory risks**

Like every Web3 project, the regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets may impede the execution of certain roadmap items. Should certain NFTs or tokens be considered securities under certain jurisdictions, this would harm our ecosystem or may impact the utilities of the XBG token.

**Data governance**

Furthermore, XBorg's utilization of third-party APIs sourced from reputable entities such as Steam and Faceit engenders potential data governance issues, as discontinuing said collaborations would inevitably result in diminished data quality.

**Credential network traction**

The adoption risk for any protocol cannot be overstated, as it represents a potential hurdle to its success. Hence, a robust initial growth plan is essential. In line with this, we have identified the Fan engagement app and strategic partnerships with esports teams as the most effective avenues for attaining the critical mass of the XBorg protocol.
